{"name":"DOSBoxGTK","tagline":"A GTK frontend for DOSBox developed in C++","body":"###Introduction\r\nDOSBoxGTK is a [DOSBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) frontend for Gnu/Linux systems and the Gnome desktop developed in C++ using the GTKmm, LibXML++ and cURLpp libraries.\r\n\r\nThe user interface is very similar to the one used by [DBGL](http://members.quicknet.nl/blankendaalr/dbgl/).\r\n\r\nAlso provides a button to retrieve game information from [MobyGames website](http://www.mobygames.com/) when creating or editing a game profile.\r\n\r\n###license info\r\nYou are welcome to modify, distribute, execute and compile this software and it's source code under the terms of the Gnu General Public License version 3, just don't forget to mention the source ;-)\r\n\r\nAny feedback and help will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n###Building dependencies\r\nin order to build DOSBoxGTK you will need:\r\n\r\n+ GNU C++ compiler (>= 4.8)\r\n+ CMake (>= 2.8.12)\r\n+ gtkmm (>= 3.10.1)\r\n+ libXML++ (>= 2.36.0)\r\n+ cURLpp (>= 0.7.3)\r\n\r\n###Building instructions\r\nThis instructions has been tested in an Ubuntu Trusty 64 bits Gnu/Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n1. Download the source from this page.\r\n\r\n2. Uncompress the downloaded file and go to the directory where the uncompressed files are.\r\n\r\n3. Create a folder for the building with a name, for example, like build and enter it:\r\n    \r\n    ```\r\n    $ mkdir build\r\n    $ cd build\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Use CMake to configure the building environment:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n   The code above will create the release version of DOSBoxGTK, which can be installed. If you want to build the debug version just use this:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n5. If you configured the building environment to create the release version of DOSBoxGTK you need to install it in the system:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ sudo make install\r\n    ```\r\n6. If you want to uninstall DOSBoxGTK just go to the directory where you built DOSBoxGTK and use:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ sudo make uninstall\r\n    ```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
